NAME
    Finance::Bank::USAA - Check your USAA accounts from Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::Bank::USAA;
      for my $account (Finance::Bank::USAA->get_balances(
          username  => $u,
          password  => $p
      )) {
          printf "%20s -> %s\n", $account->name, $account->balance;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an interface to the USAA online banking system
    at "http://www.usaa.com". Either "Crypt::SSLeay" or
    "IO::Socket::SSL" must be installed, to support HTTPS working with
    LWP. The methods this module provides are for retrieving
    information, including "check_balances" and "get_balances", which
    are synonymous. These methods return a list of account objects, each
    of which can be queried for name and balance as shown above. The
    method "display_balances" essentially executes the code shown in the
    synopsis above.

WARNING
    Taken verbatim from Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB: This is code for
    online banking, and that means your money, and that means BE
    CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source of
    this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to
    me, but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.
